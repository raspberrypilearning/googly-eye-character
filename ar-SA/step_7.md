## Upgrade your project

If you have time, you can upgrade your project.

Here are some ideas that you could try:
- Add more body parts
- Add more sprites with googly eyes
- Add more backdrops
- Add more accessories, or add more costumes to your accessories
- Try different graphic effects

Each example project in the [Introduction](.) has a **See inside** link for you to open the project in Scratch and look at the code to get ideas and see how the project works.

The **Sporg** character also has arms that `point towards`{:class="block3motion"} the mouse pointer.

**Sporg**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/495865892/editor){:target="_blank"}
<div class="scratch-preview" style="margin-left: 15px;">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/495865892/?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

If you add other body parts, you will need to centre them at the point that you want them to rotate from. For example, an arm would rotate from the shoulder.
