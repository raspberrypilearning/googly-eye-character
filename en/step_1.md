## Introduction

You will design and create a googly eye character. Googly eyes are silly large eyes, yours will follow the mouse to bring your character to life.

You will decide how many eyes your character has and make decisions about the colour and graphic effects that you use. 

You will:
+ Make a project with **user interaction**
+ Personalize a project with colour and graphic effects
+ Learn about design in digital making

### Try it
Move the mouse around the screen and watch what happens to Gobo's eyes. If you're on a tablet, move your finger around the screen. What happens when you move between Gobo's eyes?

### Get inspiration 
You are going to make some design decisions to create your character, what kind of googly eye character you want to make? how many eyes your character has, and what colour and graphic effects that you use.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">Design</span> means deciding on the way a project looks and what it does.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
"User" means the person using the project (not just making it), and <span style="color: #0faeb0">User interaction</span> is how the project reacts to the user doing things such as moving the mouse and clicking on the screen.
