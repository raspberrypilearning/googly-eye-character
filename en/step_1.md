## Introduction

You will design and create a googly eye character. Googly eyes are silly large eyes, yours will follow the mouse pointer to bring your character to life.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">Design</span> means deciding on the way a project looks and making decisions about what it does. 
</p>

You will:
+ Make a project with **user interaction**
+ Personalize a project with colour and graphic effects
+ Learn about design in digital making 

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
"User" means the person using the project (not just making it), and <span style="color: #0faeb0">User interaction</span> is how the project reacts to the user doing things such as moving the mouse and clicking on the screen.

### Try it 

Move the mouse (or your finger on a tablet) around the screen and watch what happens to Gobo's eyes.

What happens when you move between the Gobo's eyes? Try clicking on different parts to customise the scene.
