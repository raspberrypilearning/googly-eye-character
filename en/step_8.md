# Upgrade your project

If you have time you can add more to your project. 

Here are some ideas you could try:
- Add more body parts
- Add more sprites with googly eyes

If you add other body parts then you will need to centre them at the point you want them to rotate from, for example an arm would rotate from the shoulder.
