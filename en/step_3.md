## Your character

Have you got an idea about your own character? Now you can make it!

--- task ---

Open a [new Scratch project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor){:target=”_blank”} to look at the range of sprites and backdrops. Take five minutes to think about your character.

What is your character's personality? How about their mood or background story?

--- task ---

Choose a sprite **or** create your own simple sprite in the Paint editor.

You don't have to choose a person or animal, you could choose an object like the donut.

title: Paint your own character

You can create a character from shapes using the rectangle and oval tools. 

Don't add the eyes, they need to be separate sprites.

At the moment your character will be much smaller than the characters in our example projects. You can make your character bigger so that they fill more of the screen.

--- task ---

From the Sprite pane change the number in the **Size** property to a number of your choice.

Your character can live anywhere you like. You can **choose** a backdrop that is sensible or silly.
