We added this code to an eyeball sprite but the eyeball is not rotating. 

```blocks3
when flag clicked
set rotation style [all around v]
forever
point towards [mouse-pointer v]
```
Which of these  actions make the eyeball rotate?

--- choices ---

- (x) Click the green flag.

 --- feedback ---
When you have a forever loop, you always need to do something to start it running.
 --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Click on the eyeball.

 --- feedback ---
The script does not have any event that makes the eyeball rotate when the eyeball is clicked.
 --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Move `set rotation style` inside the forever loop.

 --- feedback ---
If you put `set rotation style` inside the forever loop, nothing will change.
 --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Click on the Stage.

 --- feedback ---
You don't need to click on the Stage to get the eyeball to rotate. It should just follow the mouse or your finger.
