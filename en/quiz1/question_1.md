legend: Question 1 of 3

We added this code to an eyeball sprite but the eyeball is not rotating. 

![Screenshot showing the script and Stage](images/code-not-running.png)

How could you fix the problem with just one action?

--- choices ---

- (x) Click the green flag.

 --- feedback ---
Yes! Just adding the script doesn't make it run. You need to click the green flag to make your code run.

Your code will have a yellow highlight around it when it is running.

Forgetting to click the green flag is a really common mistake, we all do it!

**Tip:** If you change code in a loop while it is running, Scratch will run the new code the next time round the loop! You don't need to click the green flag again. This is really useful when you are trying out ideas.

- ( ) Click on the eyeball.

 --- feedback ---
The script does not start with a `when this sprite clicked`{:class="block3events"} block.

- ( ) Move `set rotation style`{:class="block3looks"}  inside the forever loop.

 --- feedback ---
You don't need to run the `set rotation style`{:class="block3looks"} lots of times. Just setting it once before the loop changes it until you set it to a different style. Moving the `set rotation style`{:class="block3looks"} block won't help with this problem.

- ( ) Click on the Stage.

 --- feedback ---
You don't need to click on the Stage to get the eyeball to rotate. When the code is running it will just follow the mouse or your finger.
