<span style="color: #0faeb0">User interaction</span> is how the project reacts to the user. The googly eye project you have made probably has lots of <span style="color: #0faeb0">user interaction</span>!

Which of these scripts allows user interaction after the program has started?

 User interaction is how the project reacts to the user doing things such as moving the mouse and clicking on the screen.
