legend: Question 3 of 3
---

<span style="color: #0faeb0">User interaction</span> is how the project reacts to the user. The googly eye project you have made probably has lots of <span style="color: #0faeb0">user interaction</span>!

Which of these scripts allows user interaction after the program has started? There could be more than one correct answer. 

<mark>Can we have more than one correct answer? This might work well once repeated attempts are allowed.</mark>
