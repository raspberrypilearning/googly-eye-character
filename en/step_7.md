## Upgrade your project

If you have time you can upgrade to your project. 

Here are some ideas you could try:
- Add more body parts
- Add more sprites with googly eyes
- Add more backdrops
- Add more accessories, or add more costumes to your accessories
- Try different graphic effects

The Sporg character also has arms that `point towards`{:class="block3motion"} the mouse pointer.

**Sporg**: [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/495865892/editor){:target="_blank"}
<div class="scratch-preview" style="margin-left: 15px;">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/495865892/?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

If you add other body parts then you will need to centre them at the point you want them to rotate from, for example an arm would rotate from the shoulder.

Take a look at some Googly eye character projects created by community members in the Raspberry Pi Foundationâ€™s studio of Googly eye character Community Projects [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/29120534){:target="_blank"}.
